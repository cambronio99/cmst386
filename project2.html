        <h2>Project 4 Planning!</h2><br>
        <p class="preprocessing">
          My website is going to be an storefront / blog for a musician. I like to make music in my free time, and have a project releasing fairly soon, so I thought it could be fun to use the website as promotional material for that.

I am making the website for myself, not a client, and it will be mostly real, but the storefront will include fictitious items (not actually for sale.) As for the research that I’ll be doing for the website, I think my main plan of attack will be to look at some other musicians websites, and see how they go about marketing themselves: What does the about section say, how much is their merchandise, what is their landing page aiming to do?

Before submitting the project, I’ll make sure to go through and test each Call to action button, making sure the “add to cart” or whatever purchase CTA I end up using works properly, and double check that there are no dead links that I forgot to path out on the site.
The goal of the site will be to advertise for my upcoming project “tabula rasa” which is releasing to streaming in 4 parts, starting on June 6th and ending on June 28th. The intended target is fans of Pop/R&B style music, it will be marketed with a calm, but colorful campaign, Using Yellow, Blue, Green, and Purple to represent each release, respectively. The website will have several Easter eggs regarding the album, and will hopefully grow in meaning overtime as more songs are released. The website should only need to be updated consistently through the month of June, and following the release should be in a fairly consistent spot. I will use the album cover(s) to create some substance for the site, and hand drawn lyric pngs might bolster some of the page’s background.

Growth and Maintenance:
To ensure the website continues to evolve, regular updates are crucial. I'll monitor user engagement and feedback, integrating new features and improving existing ones. Simplifying code, optimizing images, and maintaining backups will aid in easier maintenance. Tasks such as content updates, bug fixes, and security checks should occur weekly, while major updates can be monthly.

Organization:
Content will be organized into sections: Home, About, Music, Merchandise, Blog, and Contact. Sub-topics will include bio, discography, store, and news. Pages will include Home, About, Music (with subpages for albums/songs), Store, Blog, and Contact. The layout will feature a clean design with intuitive navigation, ensuring easy access to all sections.

Security:
The website will include e-commerce and may have password-protected content, such as exclusive music downloads for subscribed users. Users may create accounts for access to exclusive content. To enhance security, I'll implement HTTPS, regularly update software, use secure passwords, and employ firewalls to protect against potential threats.
Web Hosting:
Criteria for selecting a web host include reliability, security, scalability, and customer support. Special technologies like SSL for secure transactions and shopping cart functionality will be necessary. The website will need support for HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend, and PHP for backend functionality. A suitable domain name could be "camui.com" reflecting my “stage name.”

Marketing:
Marketing will involve social media promotion and email newsletters. SEO elements such as optimizing meta tags, using relevant keywords, and creating quality content will enhance visibility. Leveraging social media platforms and engaging with the target audience will be key strategies for successful marketing.
