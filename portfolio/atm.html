        <div class="tabula-rasa-sub">this mixtape has been a long time coming. i started working on a second album, <br>
          called "falling," in late 2019. i spent most of my time the last 5 years trying to perfect <br>
          each song for that album, going through cycles of making 10-20 songs i thought could work <br>
          before making a song that was "my best yet" and feeling as though i needed to reset. <br>
          each new peak came with the thought that "none of those songs can stand up to this one." <br>
          and so 10 or 20 more songs would come, before a new peak, and a new cycle.
          <br><br> in november of 2023, in trying to transfer the data on my harddrive to a new, faster drive, <br>
          i lost access to the mixes for alot of my old songs. I was tired of restarting.<br> I knew i had hundreds of songs, and i hadn't released an music in nearly 3 years. <br>
          i have always been a bit obsessed with the idea of a cohesive concept album,<br>
          one that flows all the way through. this is not that.
          alot of these songs i don't relate to <br>
          anymore, but in taking a step back and looking at all <br>
          of the work i have done in the last 5 years of my life, i realized that i did relate to them. <br>
          and more important than that, they are a benchmark of my progress. </div><br>
